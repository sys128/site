<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Note that this page is in a <strong>major work in progress state!</strong> The general theme of the page may come in the next week or so.</p>
<p>This page aims to track the progression of a school project: a lifesize model of a Minecraft creeper in a very small field (as to not make it too large), but parts of this idea may change over time. This may also end up being (more or less) a script and/or outline for a possible video presentation that will probably be finished by the time I graduate (June 1st).</p>


<h2>January 23, 2023</h2>
<p>First day of the semester and I am immediately making some progress on the project. This is because I was working ahead of time. I am also gonna have to work on an HTML implementation of the site in my own time because of two reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>School Chromebooks are extremely limited in what they can do. Getting a text editor such as ViM installed on it would require me to find some sort of workaround to enable the use of the Linux terminal, which would no doubt get me expelled from the school district, so obviously, I can't do that. The other computers that the classrooms contain are even more locked down. It is enough so that you can't even change the keyboard layout because any attempt to access the settings will be futile. With the help of the teacher, I CAN get the layout installed but not be able to actually change it to that.</li>
  <li>Google Sites is also extremely clunky and bloated. For most computer casuals, this is usually not an issue, but for a geek such as myself, I would rather have the lightweightedness of HTML. That would also mean I have the freedom to implement things that I couldn't before, like the ability to do scrolling text, even though it will be counterintuitive in a site project such as this one.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am starting to get a sketch down, which will lay out the dimensions of the thing. One thing to note is that with this model, the base will work in terms of 1/16th of a meter (12.5 mm) as to match the pixels on a Minecraft block, but the creeper itself may be based on a different pixel length. I aim to make this as close as possible to the feel of the game, with using the look of <strong>Minecraft Java 1.6</strong> (2013) as a reference. (Due to the use of a rose.) I might have a drawing ready for tomorrow but there are no promises with that.</p>


<h2>January 24, 2023</h2>
<p>Got that sketch done in class today, though I might make a digital version of it but I do believe that having a physical one on paper will be beneficial to the process because I can slightly more easily look at the reference to see if something is right or not. But I can just as easily print something out. The reference will just a drawing on a piece of paper for now. As long as everything is on there, all will be good.</p>
<p>Here is what the sketch looks like.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/20230124_112340.jpg" alt="Creeper Sketch" width="800" height="600"></center>
<p>The reason why the base blocks at the bottom are slab-height is because it would be hard to climb up it if you wanted to stand with the creeper. In other words, it is too tall. I figured that since I wanted the textures to be consistent with Minecraft 1.6, I thought it would be a good idea to do the same thing for the size of the creeper. In 1.9, the height of the creeper was changed from 1.8 meters tall down to 1.7. Because of that, I decided to make the creeper 1.8 meters tall. I also tried a few different sizes for the base. I originally wanted to make it 4 blocks in length with a somewhat circular shape to it, but I figured that it would be too big. I settled with a square of 2x2 blocks.</p>
<p>I also did some calculations on the pixel sizes, and found that the pixel size of the creeper is larger than it is for a Minecraft block. (~6.923 cm and 6.25 cm respectively), so I will have to be a little bit careful for that, but I think it won't be an issue. I also did some Minecraft-pixel measurements on the creeper itself.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The creeper's entire body is 8 by 26 by 12 pixels in size, in terms of x, y, and z.</li>
  <li>The head of the creeper on its own is 8 x 8 x 8.</li>
  <li>The creeper's torso(?) is 8 x 12 x 4.</li>
  <li>One of the creeper's legs is 4 x 6 x 4 pixels in size.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important thing of note is that the legs do not connect to the torso on a side, but rather do so at a corner, so I will have to thing of a secure way to attach the legs to the torso without sacrificing the authenticity.</p>
<p>With this plan set in stone, I think I can start the actual building tomorrow, so I will have to prepare some sort of procedure to get the thing going.</p>


<h2>January 25, 2023</h2>
<p>I decided to start the procedure with the most boring part, making the assembly inside of OnShape. I made separate pieces for the creeper, including the ground below and then put it on the assembly. Sure enough, it looks like it should work. The creeper does not look like it is too small for the baseplate and I should be able to fit the flowers on it, just like I had hoped, just as long as the offset for them is pointed away from the creeper. (THEN, it might get in the way otherwise.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/Screenshot 2023-01-25 11.13.46.png" alt="Onshape Model"></center>
<p>I believe from here, I can start getting some of the materials. I have a couple of them to realistically choose from that I am immediately aware of. I have wood, but I also have acrylic. Both have their upsides and downsides.</p>

<h2>January 26, 2023</h2>
<p>Here, we arrive at my first hurdle! My first decision landed on the acrylic route, mainly because of the lightness and the smoothness of the material. (I certainly do not want to be getting splinters just from working with wood.) But a major downside is something I have overlooked yesterday. The laser cutters are not big enough to do something of this size, so I will have to spend some time thinking of how I am going to piece it up effectively... And 40x28 inch sheets of acrylic is expensive ($250 for 8 sheets, which still isn't nearly enough sheets!), so I am gonna have to suck it up with wood.</p>
<p>With that figured out, I also decided to start making some parts inside of Adobe Illustrator. I don't know how many sheets of plywood I will need for this project yet, so I will not overestimate when the school goes out and orders some wood. I will also say that there is a chance that the baseplate will be made a quarter-block instead of a half-block, but that has yet to be decided.</p>


<h2>January 27, 2023</h2>
<p>Updating the site for grading purposes. Expect to see updates like this every week. I needed to finally embed the images, but I also plan to make size-efficient vectors for some of these, because they really don't need to be in the PNG format. I will get to that eventually but I don't know when. That will just have to depend on my productivity.</p>


<h2>January 30, 2023</h2>
<p>New week! This monday was spent making plans for the baseplate, which is what the creeper will stand on. Since the machines, according to the school, works best with Adobe Illustrator, that is what I am gonna have to go with for vector-based planning going forward. Some other software that the school provides will also be used. Thankfully, I have just enough experience in these programs to get by with using them. Though, if it were completely up to me, I would have gone for different software, such as Inkscape, but that is another topic for another day</p>
<p>In these designs, I have to keep in mind some of the mistakes I made last time when I was making that vending machine, assuming the instructor remembers what I did for that class, and the main thing that artificially extended the process was sanding everything down, which took a month out of the entire process, and I don't want to make that mistake again. There was a minor detail that we missed while we were doing that project. That was the use of tolerance.</p>
<p>Tolerance is defined as an allowed deviation from a standard measurement. For instance, a tolerance of Â±0.1 inches means that you can have 0.1 inches more or less than the measurement that you are intended and it will still work out just as fine. For the baseplate, I went with that 0.1 inch area of tolerance, but the downside to that is how the other measurements are in centimeters, so there is going to be some of that inconsistency. We can also say that the tolerance is 0.25 centimeters and call it a day, because it is just under 0.1 inches. (If need be, we can use the exact 0.254 cm metric.)</p>
<p>This will be cut out of wood so we have to know what the wood-cutting machine is able to work with. (The machine's name is the ShopBot, which will be referred to in this way from now on.) The ShopBot is able to work with wood up to 8ft by 4ft in area, so undoubtedly, many Illustrator documents will have to be made. Two were created to fit every part of the baseplate, of which are pictured below.</p>

<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/base_top_ai.png" alt="Baseplate Top Plans"></center>


<h2>January 31, 2023</h2>
<p>Moving on from the baseplate plans, the next thing to work on is the head of the creeper. So I quickly put a cube together in Adobe Illustrator, but I also wanted to test how well it turned out. I downscaled it and cut it out on a laser cutter. It took a few attempts because I needed to refamiliarize myself with it. It had been several months since I used that thing. It was kind of difficult to put together</p>
<p>Because of the thing being made for wood and not cardboard, putting the thing together to make sure the tabs were in the right spot was kind of a balancing act. This was because the depth of the cardboard was not the same as the depth of the wood that is meant to work with, and to match it, it will have to be ridiculously small. It took a few tries, but in the end, it did end up working!</p>
<p>So, that means the head is covered and I can move on to the next bit.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/creeper-1.png" alt="Creeper Head Cube"></center>


<h2>February 1, 2023</h2>
<p>Happy new month!</p>
<p>To start this February, I started work on the legs, which there are obviously four of.</p>
<p>I also ended up using a different tolerance, this time being 0.05 inches aka 0.127 cm, which probably won't matter very much because they will glued anyway.</p>
<p>I also decided to make the tabs on the legs smaller than they are on the head, maybe this will make them a little bit more sturdier, but I am not quite sure of this. That statement may be incorrect.</p>
<p>Though, I am not quite finished with the legs yet, so a screenshot of them will have to be provided tomorrow instead.</p>


<h2>February 2, 2023</h2>
<p>The next thing to do today was to work a little bit more on the legs. Luckily, since I figured out how to do the others by experience, this one was not too difficult to set up. For four legs, I can just prepare half of one leg, duplicate it once and fix some tolerance, and then duplicate that pair 4 times to make four legs in total.</p>
<p>When I went back to check on the other things, I realized something that I am glad I found out before cutting it out. The tabs were not set up correctly! What happened was that the tabs were extending out past their measurements, making the head too large or even making it a pain to put together. The tab's edges are supposed to align with the edges of the square it is based off of.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/creeper-2.png" alt="Creeper Legs"></center>


<h2>February 3, 2023</h2>
<p>Site day. Some of the days may still be in a bullet point state but they should be the minimum requirement to get credit for it.</p>


<h2>February 6, 2023</h2>
<p>Not as much happened today, but I did make some progress nonetheless. Today, I worked more on the torso of the creeper. I thought about where I can put tabs and where it wouldn't be necessary. The head covers the top of the torso, so I decided not to put tabs there. I also decided to have the bottom be a solid rectangle so idealy, I can just push it in instead of using tabs. If this does not work out as intended, then I will think of another way.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/base_torso_ai.png" alt="Creeper Torso"></center>

<h2>February 7, 2023</h2>
<p>So, I did some final checks on the 2d modelling, including reducing the amount of space it takes up from 3 whole sheets of wood to only 2 and a half sheets. It's not a big difference, but I am sure my instructor would appreciate it anyway. After I did the checks, I put it all in VCarve to see how the program would react to my .ai files. As it turns out, it was a bit screwy.</p>
<p>The path that the ShopBot would need to go is all over the place and looks messy! The lines of the cuts were not in the right spot. It would likely make something that wouldn't even be able to be separated from the wood.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/bad_cuts.png" alt="Ew!"></center>
<p><strong>What is going on here?</strong> That is actually because I forgot to join the lines into full shapes before putting it into VCarve. And it ended up working very nicely! Now I can make the cuts properly, right?</p>
<p>oh.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/error.png"></center>
<p>I went out and tried to find out what about the shape was causing this error. And I was able to discover that one of the corners was not lined up properly. It is on a miniscule scale but it is there. This next image is zoomed in 8500%, showing the error that caused the vector to not be cut out properly in VCarve.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/error_reason.png" alt="Womp womp!"></center>
<p>With that all fixed up, I finally got the toolpath files and VCarve project files saved onto the drive so I don't have to do it later. And now, it's time for the actual fun part of today! I decided to figure out how I am going to do the flowers! Since we need to be 1:1 in this project, that means we have to keep in mind that flowers in Minecraft are absolutely gigantic! Since, a rose is 11 pixels in height, assuming each pixel is 6.25 cm, that means, we have 68.75 cm high flowers! Woulda thunk.</p>
<p>So we need to figure out how to turn the flowers into clean vectors that we can work with. Turning it into one automatically, not only is not viable due to the usage of different colors, the lines it makes are also not very straight. <strong>No good!</strong> There may have been a better way to do this but what I ended up doing was making a grid of squares and then aligning them with the pixels of the rose.</p>
<p>From there, I can delete the squares I don't want in the image, and lastly, I can trace the outside of those squares to create the general shape of the flower. And <em>if I remember to JOIN IT this time</em>, we get the final shape! And it looks wonderful!</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/flower_prep.png" alt="Before the alignment"></center>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/flower_transformation.png" alt="Image to vector outline"></center>


<h2>February 8, 2023</h2>
<p>Pressed on to finish the flower model today, and it was actually rather easy to do what I am gonna do next. You see, in Minecraft, flowers are not one plane. They are actually two planes, formed in a cross shape, with the intersection being in the middle. So, it was up to me to figure out how I am gonna do the intersection.<p>
<p>I decided to cut a section down the middle (of the right thickness and call it a day.) It may not be the most secure way of doing it. Considering the shape of the flower however, this was what I thought up of for this specific flower. For the dandelion, there might as well be a better way to do it.</p>
<p>I was about to test out how it would fit together, but as it turns out, we have no cardboard that is large enough to fit it. Most people use cardboard for smaller things than what I am doing so the thought had not come to the heads of the higher-ups.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the class period thinking about how the texturing is going to play out. There are two possible avenues I can venture on. I could either paint the squares on by hand or print out countless pieces of paper in color and find out where they go, and glue them together. I did not want to do the painting one, which was recommended by the instructor, because of the number of pixels I would have to paint in, not even counting how I would need to get the colors accurately.</p>
<p>To prove my point, I did a pixel count on the entire plan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dandelion : 62 pixels</li>
  <li>Rose      : 60 pixels</li>
  <li>Head      : 352 pixels</li>
  <li>Body      : 272 pixels</li>
  <li>Legs      : 288 pixels</li>
  <li>Baseplate : 2048 pixels</li>
  <li>Total     : 3082 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>If we assume that each pixels takes a minute to paint, I would be painting for 51.37 hours straight, no breaks. <strong>Not feasible!</strong></p>
<p>For paper, that could give me a cost on my end, but that might not be true. (I was assuming there was a cost to printing in color because that was how they did it at my old school before moving here.)</p>


<h2>February 9, 2023</h2>
<p>Was a bit behind on the site in the past school week, so I dedicated today to get that as updated as I could. This will likely become a regular thing I do on Thursdays and/or Fridays.</p>


<h2>February 10, 2023</h2>
<p>I could not get much done today because I had to attend an IEP meeting. But in the meantime, I updated the site a little bit more. The meeting took up most of the class period, so there was barely a difference in it anyway.</p>


<h2>February 13, 2023</h2>
<p>I am continuing to explore my options as to how to solve the puzzle on how to efficiently texture the creeper and its surroundings. Remember when I mentioned how I am gonna see if using pieces of paper will be a viable option? Well, while it is indeed an improvement over painting each square individually, there is still work needed on this method. (As in, it will still take a substantial amount of time.</p>
<p>I did some measurements on the baseplate, using a square meter of the grass part for reference. </p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/sheets_calc.png" alt="Diagram of one square meter of grass."></center>


<h2>February 14, 2023</h2>
<p>- I did try a couple of times to cut out the rose, but both of those attempts failed.</p>
<p>- that is because of the y-level being incorrect. i forgot to turn on the auto focus when i went to print the thing out</p>
<p>- I ran out of time before I could do it for the third time</p>


<h2>February 15, 2023</h2>
<p>Things did in fact, turn up today! The third time was the charm in this case... well, kind of. The first half of the rose model turned out okay but some misalignment happened on the second half so I had to stop the printing process early. Because of that early success, I quickly got to the next step of the flower-making process. I had to glue it together. I tried two different kinds of glue. The first one was school glue, which I found took way too long to dry, and on top of that, I was not confident in it holding together, even after it did dry. Instead, I opted to use hot glue instead. At the cost of some safety precautions (which I won't break if I am not an idiot), I can have the drying process speed up to just one minute or maybe even less.</p>
<p>As expected, this worked beautifully! This flower model presents a neat realization. Lifesize Minecraft flowers are gigantic! Seeing as they are larger than a slab in the vanilla game, this really puts it to scale. I don't know how many flowers in real life that are larger than Minecraft roses, but definitely no roses that I know of in real life compare to the size of the Minecraft rose.</p>
(picture of the rose so far)


<h2>February 17, 2023</h2>
<p>Due to a winter storm, we had a snow day yesterday. Today is dedicated to a site day, because it is Friday.</p>


<h2>February 20, 2023</h2>
<p>If you paid enough attention to the design plans, you would have noticed that the rose is not the only flower that is going to be on the finished product. There is also a dandelion that will sit on the opposite corner to the rose. Thankfully, I just need to do the exact same method that I did for the rose on the dandelion.</p>
<p>So, I quickly made something in Illustrator. Once again, I did use the same design methods for this one because of it being made out of a very small number of pixels.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/dandelion.png" alt="Illustrator plan of the dandelion."></center>


<h2>February 21, 2023</h2>
<p>I spent pretty much all of today's class period trying to find a good way to get the ShopBot set up for cutting out my creeper. But the main problem was the lack of good wood to use. Most of the sheets were either the wrong size, wrong thickness, or were already partially used. All of my parts cannot fit in the empty spaces in the used ones, and I am pretty sure that it would be a major pain to get everything cut out in the right spots.</p>
<p>That was until I found a 4ft by 4ft sheet of 3/4 inch wood. I was about to procced with it as normal... until i tried to clamp it all down... It turns out that the wood was so warped, that it was practically unusable. I told my instructor about it, and asked if there was any more wood to use. He said that I can use other wood, but the only other choices were to use ones of a different thickness.</p>
<p>I had to make a hard decision. The design I spent a good while on, one I thought I have perfected, had to be redesigned to fit the new thickness... Uuugh. Back to Illustrator and VCarve it is. But I ran out of time, so I will have to start it the next time I come to it. Here is an image of the wood for documentation purposes.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/wood-0.5inch.jpg" alt="Here is some wood!"></center>


<h2>February 24, 2023</h2>
<p>What an unexpected event this is. We were delighted to have two snow days in a row due to the snow on the ground being icy! (Though, it still kind of is. I had to be careful on my way to school today.) So, I have to do some catching up on potentially lost progress that could have been made up for if we didn't have snow days.
<p>I have done SOME progress on tweaking the design to fit the half-inch requirement instead of 3/4 inch, but I focused more on the site because there as still spots where I have not finished typing things. Reminder to still finish up the entry for February 14th...<p>


<h2>February 28, 2023</h2>
<p>It is going to be a bit of a short week this week because of parent-teacher conferences. I dedicated today to printing out the required paper for texturing the rose. I WAS going to do some progress on the ShopBot, but someone had already called dibs on it. And I have been told that they spend most of the class period not actually working with the ShopBot, and then spend the rest trying to figure out how it works. Hopefully, this is just an exaggeration and I don't have to spend weeks waiting for the thing to be available only to find that I do not have enough time to put the creeper together.</p>
<p>However, texturing was pretty much the best thing that I could do. I have been suggested to do painting a lot by my peers for some reason, but I was heavily deterred by the time it would take and the amount of error that each pixel could have. I would rather have a consistent error rather than a variable error. I think printing would still bring out the most accurate possible product.</p>


<h2>March 1, 2023</h2>
<p>I spent all of the class period today cutting out the flower textures. I did glue some of it on, but did not get very much of it glued on quite yet.</p>


<h2>March 2, 2023</h2>
<p>I realized that I had only printed (and cut out) only half of what I needed for the rose. I forgot to take into account that there is a whole other side of the flower to work with. So I went back and printed some more paper, and then I started cutting them out. However, since the class period was 20 minutes today, I could not get much progress done on it.</p>
<p>What I did was flip the other images that I have already used to print out the first half of the flower, so that I can use it for the second part of the flower. An image of it is shown below.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/flipped.png" alt="All 8 of the images needed for the rose."></center>

<p>(either the first or the second has a picture of the rose with half of the textures glued on but I have to figure out which day that is. Some documentation might have to be edited due to this.)</p>


<h2>March 8, 2023</h2>
<p>During the weekend, I finally got the repository for my sys128.github.com site up to date on my main home computer, which is a Linux box. But that is not important to know. As for today, I spent it STILL confused as to why the ShopBot was not cutting in the right place with my toolpaths. The files themselves seem to be perfectly fine as is. This is gonna be a pain to fix, won't it?</p>


<h2>March 9, 2023</h2>
<p>I decided to start work on the dandelion, and taking into account the things I learned from the rose, I had to make all 8 of the images immediately instead of having to do four after realizing something was wrong. However, I did have some trouble trying to upscale the image properly. In Photoshop, when I tried to upscale the image with Nearest Neighbor (which preserves the hard edges), it resampled to Bilinear anyway. So, I handeled the situation in the most professional way possible...</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/photoshop_is_stupid.png" alt="I had to upscale this image in Paint."></center>
<p>... by using MS Paint.</p>
<p>


<h2>March 10, 2023</h2>
<p>Had to do some adjusting on my toolpath files. I think it was a good thing that I have fixed my offset problem yet, because I would have had to sand down the corners manually. Let me explain.</p>
<p>To make parts easier to fit together, objects will have these things called "fillets" made into the inside corners. This helps with getting other parts to go in all the way. When combined with tolerance of a decent size and glue, the pieces should go together just fine! I managed to get the fillets in on most of the corners. There were a few that I did not get to do because of the weird composition of how I did the vectors (they aren't perfect), but I do not forsee it being a big issue.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/fillets.png" alt="A closeup of the fillets used on the inside corners."></center>


<h2>March 13, 2023</h2>
<p>Site day, because I am apparently too lazy to update the days as they happen. :(</p>


<h2>March 14, 2023</h2>
<p>There was something that I forgot to put in for the 8th, but thought it would be more worth making its own entry. I got my rose finished! I believe the 8th was fully dedicated to getting the rose done, but I overlooked it when I was trying to do documentation work for the 13th. When I was finally finished with the rose, I also got a nice image of the result, and for scale, I set it aside a fully elongated caliper.</p>
(image of the rose and caliper go here. the image was taken 3/8)


<h2>March 15, 2023</h2>
<p>I finished the dandelion! And it looks absolutely gorgeous! I am not disrespecting the rose though. I like them both equally! I went through the exact same process as I did for the other flower, so I don't think I can add very much to this. Nothing was put next to it for scale this time unfortunately.</p>

<p>Today, I had to bite the bullet and go back to figuring what is wrong with the ShopBot. From what I know at this point in time. THe file is offset a bit too much for the ShopBot to properly cut. It is after class at this point, so what I am thinking is since the file has nothing wrong with it that we could find, it may not have zeroed correctly. I will make sure it is properly zeroed the next time I get back to the ShopBot.</p>


<h2>March 17, 2023</h2>
<p>I got the ShopBot to work today! As you could probably tell, this got me decently excited! My guess was correct, and the zero point was, in fact, incorrect. I even took a picture when it finally started cutting!</p>

<p>However, this did not last long because my instructor was hesitant about something so he stopped to tell me that I did not turn on the vacuum. That wasn't a big deal. But what messed everything up was me trying to resume, because I clicked a button too early. We ran out of time before we could start over with the cutting process. <strong>We were so close to success, but we just missed the mark!!</strong> Maybe next week, things will turn out better for me. As a bonus, here is an SVG representation of my face when we ran into this situation. Because I feel like it.</p>

<h2>March 20, 2023</h2>
<p>The week is not off to a good start, because <strong>Egads! A part of the ShopBot is broken!</strong> The broken part in specific is the wire that connects a zero plate to the ShopBot. While the bot itself still works, it just becomes a real pain to set our origin point without it, so it was our safest bet to not use it until a replacement part comes in, which could take up to a few weeks. Now what? I spent the rest of the day figuring out what I could do during this downtime. I think I am running out of things at this point because most of it involves the ShotBot.</p>


<h2>March 21, 2023</h2>
<p>I spent today waiting for the replacement part for the ShopBot as you could expect. This time, I decided to try to play around with one of the Arduino boards. They run on a modified version of the C programming language so I used that time to familiarize myself a little bit to C syntax, even though most of my programming experience was for programs that only run on the desktop, and are in Python or Rust. I even tried out an LCD screen. I didn't get it to display anything properly, but it was fun anyway.</p>


<h2>March 22, 2023</h2>
<p>I think the gods might have bestoyed their mighty energy upon me because the replacement part has arrived early, and that means it should be safe to zero the Z axis properly again! <em>Hooray!</em> I spent the entire class period immediately in the ShopBot room making sure everything was good to go, and to get it to cut. And sure enough, some of the parts were cut out! Of course, the class period was not long enough to cut out everything, but it got about halfway through.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the pieces that were cut out. Hopefully, they fit together okay.</p>

<h2>March 23, 2023</h2>
<p>Luckily, the rest of the pieces were cut out by another student that wanted to help out. Or was it a teacher. I have no idea, but I would like to thank whoever that was who was willing to help out with that! Anyway, now I know that four of the pieces of the creeper leg fit together and not the top and the bottom. The dimension are correct for the other four pieces, so the only explanation was the two pieces were just too big! My instructor wants to find empty space on another 0.5 inch sheet that was used before because a new sheet is about $100, and I don't think they would appreciate me buring a hole in their budget. They are already facing financial issues for staffing as it is.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the top and bottom pieces are the same for all of the legs and I only cut out two of them, so I can just fix the legs and re-cut the two that were cut out already. If I manage to find space on another sheet, it won't be that big of a deal.</p>

<h2>March 24, 2023</h2>
<p>It is the day spring break starts. <em>I think it starts at the time school is dismissed personally.</em> So of course, I will have to make sure that my documentation is up to date. I will have to put in the images on the webpage when I remember to, which shouldn't be very long from now, but knowing me, my brain always finds a way to forget. Hoping for the best! At worst, the instructor would know my intention of where the images would go. He trusts me enough... right...?</p>


<h2>April 3, 2023</h2>
<p>I found the real issue with the fitting. It is not exactly what I thought it was before. The <strong>real</strong> issue with the fitting is that two of the pieces were misaligned and too <strong>short<strong> on one axis, not long on the others. I fixed them.</p>
<p>After that, I cut out one of the replacement pieces. The reason why I only got one of them in was because I screwed up the second one big time. The wood shifted a lot after cutting the first one out. So I <strong>definitely</strong> have to recut that one.</p>

<center><p><strong><em>EPIC FAIL!!</em></strong></p></center>
<p>That's no matter though. There is a whole other side of the wood I was using, so I can just use that tomorrow!</p>


<h2>April 4, 2023</h2>
<p>- I cut out the second piece, which was a bit more bendy than the other because of the wood type I used.</p>
<p>- Probably will not be an issue once glued.</p>

<h2>April 5, 2023</h2>
<p>- I forgot to put fillets on the inside corners and now I have to make them myself with a dremmel. Fun.</p>

<h2>April 11, 2023</h2>
<p>- Started to model out the final toolpaths that should be cut out. After that, there shouldn't be that much to do on the cutting front, unless there are mistakes that I gotta fix.</p>
<p>- Describe screenshot</p>
<p>(screenshot of the thing)</p>


<h2>April 12, 2023</h2>
<p>- I got the files prepared and will cut them out tomorrow.</p>
<p>- Problem with fillets. I think it will take forever</p>
<p>(Screenshot)</p>


<h2>April 13, 2023</h2>
<p>- I got part of the second part of the creeper model cut out but I ran out of time before I could finish. It was 61.5% of the way through.</p>
<p>- Making the fillets while cutting it live. I had to be careful. Wasn't so bad</p>


<h2>April 14, 2023</h2>
<p>- Documentation day</p>
<p>- Plans to make textures for the creeper over the weekend to speed things up.</p>
<p>- Little worried about time constraints, but I still think it will be possible to complete by the end of the year.</p>
  
  
  <h2>April 20, 2023</h2>
  <p>Had to look for a creeper texture. Not sure why I had a bit of trouble doing it, but I did manage to find one on the ol' Minecraft Wiki. It gave me a chance to learn how UV worked for Minecraft character models. Most of the part of the body is unwrapped like a cube, but the bottom texture is more disconnected from everything else. This pattern is at least mostly consistent with every body part in the game. The most obvious ones that stuck out to me were the heads of the models, because of them being a cube most of the time. Talking about this should be a sign that I am gonna begin texturing things.</p>

  <h2>April 21, 2023</h2>
  <p>I got right to work on the textures for the creeper today. I decided to start going for the easiest part, the head... okay, maybe they are about the same difficulty, but I think the head is just the natural starting point. When I was playing around with the pixel sizes, I found that if the pixels align with the true scale of the Minecraft creeper, I can pretty much perfecly fit a 12-pixel 3x4 area onto the piece of paper. With this in mind, each side of the head being 8x8, we can print out 6 pieces of paper and they should fit perfectly onto the wood. I had enough time in class to get done with the top and bottom of the head, including the printing and cutting out processes.</p>

  <h2>April 24, 2023</h2>
  <p>Progress update with the texturing. All of the images needed are on the school computer so I didn't do any texturing at home, but during class today, I got the right side and front side of the head completed and cut out.</p>
  
  
  <h2>April 25, 2023</h2>
  <p>- The rest of the head is now prepared.</p>
  <p>- THese have also been printed out</p>
