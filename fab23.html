<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Note that this page is in a <strong>major work in progress state!</strong> The general theme of the page may come in the next week or so.</p>
<p>This page aims to track the progression of a school project: a lifesize model of a Minecraft creeper in a very small field (as to not make it too large), but parts of this idea may change over time. This may also end up being (more or less) a script and/or outline for a possible video presentation that will probably be finished by the time I graduate (June 1st).</p>


<h2>January 23, 2023</h2>
<p>First day of the semester and I am immediately making some progress on the project. This is because I was working ahead of time. I am also gonna have to work on an HTML implementation of the site in my own time because of two reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>School Chromebooks are extremely limited in what they can do. Getting a text editor such as ViM installed on it would require me to find some sort of workaround to enable the use of the Linux terminal, which would no doubt get me expelled from the school district, so obviously, I can't do that. The other computers that the classrooms contain are even more locked down. It is enough so that you can't even change the keyboard layout because any attempt to access the settings will be futile. With the help of the teacher, I CAN get the layout installed but not be able to actually change it to that.</li>
  <li>Google Sites is also extremely clunky and bloated. For most computer casuals, this is usually not an issue, but for a geek such as myself, I would rather have the lightweightedness of HTML. That would also mean I have the freedom to implement things that I couldn't before, like the ability to do scrolling text, even though it will be counterintuitive in a site project such as this one.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am starting to get a sketch down, which will lay out the dimensions of the thing. One thing to note is that with this model, the base will work in terms of 1/16th of a meter (12.5 mm) as to match the pixels on a Minecraft block, but the creeper itself may be based on a different pixel length. I aim to make this as close as possible to the feel of the game, with using the look of <strong>Minecraft Java 1.6</strong> (2013) as a reference. (Due to the use of a rose.) I might have a drawing ready for tomorrow but there are no promises with that.</p>


<h2>January 24, 2023</h2>
<p>Got that sketch done in class today, though I might make a digital version of it but I do believe that having a physical one on paper will be beneficial to the process because I can slightly more easily look at the reference to see if something is right or not. But I can just as easily print something out. The reference will just a drawing on a piece of paper for now. As long as everything is on there, all will be good.</p>
<p>Here is what the sketch looks like.</p>
<p>(there will be an image here at some point trust me)</p>
<p>The reason why the base blocks at the bottom are slab-height is because it would be hard to climb up it if you wanted to stand with the creeper. In other words, it is too tall. I figured that since I wanted the textures to be consistent with Minecraft 1.6, I thought it would be a good idea to do the same thing for the size of the creeper. In 1.9, the height of the creeper was changed from 1.8 meters tall down to 1.7. Because of that, I decided to make the creeper 1.8 meters tall. I also tried a few different sizes for the base. I originally wanted to make it 4 blocks in length with a somewhat circular shape to it, but I figured that it would be too big. I settled with a square of 2x2 blocks.</p>
<p>I also did some calculations on the pixel sizes, and found that the pixel size of the creeper is larger than it is for a Minecraft block. (~6.923 cm and 6.25 cm respectively), so I will have to be a little bit careful for that, but I think it won't be an issue. I also did some Minecraft-pixel measurements on the creeper itself.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The creeper's entire body is 8 by 26 by 12 pixels in size, in terms of x, y, and z.</li>
  <li>The head of the creeper on its own is 8 x 8 x 8.</li>
  <li>The creeper's torso(?) is 8 x 12 x 4.</li>
  <li>One of the creeper's legs is 4 x 6 x 4 pixels in size.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important thing of note is that the legs do not connect to the torso on a side, but rather do so at a corner, so I will have to thing of a secure way to attach the legs to the torso without sacrificing the authenticity.</p>
<p>With this plan set in stone, I think I can start the actual building tomorrow, so I will have to prepare some sort of procedure to get the thing going.</p>


<h2>January 25, 2023</h2>
<p>I decided to start the procedure with the most boring part, making the assembly inside of OnShape. I made separate pieces for the creeper, including the ground below and then put it on the assembly. Sure enough, it looks like it should work. The creeper does not look like it is too small for the baseplate and I should be able to fit the flowers on it, just like I had hoped, just as long as the offset for them is pointed away from the creeper. (THEN, it might get in the way otherwise.</p>
<p>(Insert image here of the creeper assembly inside of Onshape)</p>
<p>I believe from here, I can start getting some of the materials. I have a couple of them to realistically choose from that I am immediately aware of. I have wood, but I also have acrylic. Both have their upsides and downsides.</p>

<h2>January 26, 2023</h2>
<p>Here, we arrive at my first hurdle! My first decision landed on the acrylic route, mainly because of the lightness and the smoothness of the material. (I certainly do not want to be getting splinters just from working with wood.) But a major downside is something I have overlooked yesterday. The laser cutters are not big enough to do something of this size, so I will have to spend some time thinking of how I am going to piece it up effectively... And 40x28 inch sheets of acrylic is expensive ($250 for 8 sheets, which still isn't nearly enough sheets!), so I am gonna have to suck it up with wood.</p>
<p>With that figured out, I also decided to start making some parts inside of Adobe Illustrator. I don't know how many sheets of plywood I will need for this project yet, so I will not overestimate when the school goes out and orders some wood. I will also say that there is a chance that the baseplate will be made a quarter-block instead of a half-block, but that has yet to be decided.</p>
