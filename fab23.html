<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Note that this page is in a <strong>major work in progress state!</strong> The general theme of the page may come in the next week or so.</p>
<p>This page aims to track the progression of a school project: a lifesize model of a Minecraft creeper in a very small field (as to not make it too large), but parts of this idea may change over time. This may also end up being (more or less) a script and/or outline for a possible video presentation that will probably be finished by the time I graduate (June 1st).</p>


<h2>January 23, 2023</h2>
<p>First day of the semester and I am immediately making some progress on the project. This is because I was working ahead of time. I am also gonna have to work on an HTML implementation of the site in my own time because of two reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>School Chromebooks are extremely limited in what they can do. Getting a text editor such as ViM installed on it would require me to find some sort of workaround to enable the use of the Linux terminal, which would no doubt get me expelled from the school district, so obviously, I can't do that. The other computers that the classrooms contain are even more locked down. It is enough so that you can't even change the keyboard layout because any attempt to access the settings will be futile. With the help of the teacher, I CAN get the layout installed but not be able to actually change it to that.</li>
  <li>Google Sites is also extremely clunky and bloated. For most computer casuals, this is usually not an issue, but for a geek such as myself, I would rather have the lightweightedness of HTML. That would also mean I have the freedom to implement things that I couldn't before, like the ability to do scrolling text, even though it will be counterintuitive in a site project such as this one.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am starting to get a sketch down, which will lay out the dimensions of the thing. One thing to note is that with this model, the base will work in terms of 1/16th of a meter (12.5 mm) as to match the pixels on a Minecraft block, but the creeper itself may be based on a different pixel length. I aim to make this as close as possible to the feel of the game, with using the look of <strong>Minecraft Java 1.6</strong> (2013) as a reference. (Due to the use of a rose.) I might have a drawing ready for tomorrow but there are no promises with that.</p>


<h2>January 24, 2023</h2>
<p>Got that sketch done in class today, though I might make a digital version of it but I do believe that having a physical one on paper will be beneficial to the process because I can slightly more easily look at the reference to see if something is right or not. But I can just as easily print something out. The reference will just a drawing on a piece of paper for now. As long as everything is on there, all will be good.</p>
<p>Here is what the sketch looks like.</p>
<center><img src="assets/images/fab23/20230124_112340.jpg" alt="Creeper Sketch" width="800" height="600"></center>
<p>The reason why the base blocks at the bottom are slab-height is because it would be hard to climb up it if you wanted to stand with the creeper. In other words, it is too tall. I figured that since I wanted the textures to be consistent with Minecraft 1.6, I thought it would be a good idea to do the same thing for the size of the creeper. In 1.9, the height of the creeper was changed from 1.8 meters tall down to 1.7. Because of that, I decided to make the creeper 1.8 meters tall. I also tried a few different sizes for the base. I originally wanted to make it 4 blocks in length with a somewhat circular shape to it, but I figured that it would be too big. I settled with a square of 2x2 blocks.</p>
<p>I also did some calculations on the pixel sizes, and found that the pixel size of the creeper is larger than it is for a Minecraft block. (~6.923 cm and 6.25 cm respectively), so I will have to be a little bit careful for that, but I think it won't be an issue. I also did some Minecraft-pixel measurements on the creeper itself.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The creeper's entire body is 8 by 26 by 12 pixels in size, in terms of x, y, and z.</li>
  <li>The head of the creeper on its own is 8 x 8 x 8.</li>
  <li>The creeper's torso(?) is 8 x 12 x 4.</li>
  <li>One of the creeper's legs is 4 x 6 x 4 pixels in size.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important thing of note is that the legs do not connect to the torso on a side, but rather do so at a corner, so I will have to thing of a secure way to attach the legs to the torso without sacrificing the authenticity.</p>
<p>With this plan set in stone, I think I can start the actual building tomorrow, so I will have to prepare some sort of procedure to get the thing going.</p>


<h2>January 25, 2023</h2>
<p>I decided to start the procedure with the most boring part, making the assembly inside of OnShape. I made separate pieces for the creeper, including the ground below and then put it on the assembly. Sure enough, it looks like it should work. The creeper does not look like it is too small for the baseplate and I should be able to fit the flowers on it, just like I had hoped, just as long as the offset for them is pointed away from the creeper. (THEN, it might get in the way otherwise.</p>

<p>I believe from here, I can start getting some of the materials. I have a couple of them to realistically choose from that I am immediately aware of. I have wood, but I also have acrylic. Both have their upsides and downsides.</p>

<h2>January 26, 2023</h2>
<p>Here, we arrive at my first hurdle! My first decision landed on the acrylic route, mainly because of the lightness and the smoothness of the material. (I certainly do not want to be getting splinters just from working with wood.) But a major downside is something I have overlooked yesterday. The laser cutters are not big enough to do something of this size, so I will have to spend some time thinking of how I am going to piece it up effectively... And 40x28 inch sheets of acrylic is expensive ($250 for 8 sheets, which still isn't nearly enough sheets!), so I am gonna have to suck it up with wood.</p>
<p>With that figured out, I also decided to start making some parts inside of Adobe Illustrator. I don't know how many sheets of plywood I will need for this project yet, so I will not overestimate when the school goes out and orders some wood. I will also say that there is a chance that the baseplate will be made a quarter-block instead of a half-block, but that has yet to be decided.</p>


<h2>January 27, 2023</h2>
<p>Updating the site for grading purposes. Expect to see updates like this every week. I needed to finally embed the images, but I also plan to make size-efficient vectors for some of these, because they really don't need to be in the PNG format. I will get to that eventually but I don't know when. That will just have to depend on my productivity.</p>


<h2>January 30, 2023</h2>
<p>New week! This monday was spent making plans for the baseplate, which is what the creeper will stand on. Since the machines, according to the school, works best with Adobe Illustrator, that is what I am gonna have to go with for vector-based planning going forward. Some other software that the school provides will also be used. Thankfully, I have just enough experience in these programs to get by with using them. Though, if it were completely up to me, I would have gone for different software, such as Inkscape, but that is another topic for another day</p>
<p>In these designs, I have to keep in mind some of the mistakes I made last time when I was making that vending machine, assuming the instructor remembers what I did for that class, and the main thing that artificially extended the process was sanding everything down, which took a month out of the entire process, and I don't want to make that mistake again. There was a minor detail that we missed while we were doing that project. That was the use of tolerance.</p>
<p>Tolerance is defined as an allowed deviation from a standard measurement. For instance, a tolerance of Â±0.1 inches means that you can have 0.1 inches more or less than the measurement that you are intended and it will still work out just as fine. For the baseplate, I went with that 0.1 inch area of tolerance, but the downside to that is how the other measurements are in centimeters, so there is going to be some of that inconsistency. We can also say that the tolerance is 0.25 centimeters and call it a day, because it is just under 0.1 inches. (If need be, we can use the exact 0.254 cm metric.)</p>
<p>This will be cut out of wood so we have to know what the wood-cutting machine is able to work with. (The machine's name is the ShopBot, which will be referred to in this way from now on.) The ShopBot is able to work with wood up to 8ft by 4ft in area, so undoubtedly, many Illustrator documents will have to be made. Two were created to fit every part of the baseplate, of which are pictured below.</p>

<h2>January 31, 2023</h2>
<p>Moving on from the baseplate plans, the next thing to work on is the head of the creeper. So I quickly put a cube together in Adobe Illustrator, but I also wanted to test how well it turned out. I downscaled it and cut it out on a laser cutter. It took a few attempts because I needed to refamiliarize myself with it. It had been several months since I used that thing. It was kind of difficult to put together</p>
<p>Because of the thing being made for wood and not cardboard, putting the thing together to make sure the tabs were in the right spot was kind of a balancing act. This was because the depth of the cardboard was not the same as the depth of the wood that is meant to work with, and to match it, it will have to be ridiculously small. It took a few tries, but in the end, it did end up working!</p>
<p>So, that means the head is covered and I can move on to the next bit.</p>

<h2>February 1, 2023</h2>
<p>Happy new month!</p>
<p>- Started the legs, which there are obviously four of</p>
<p>- Ended up using a different tolerance, which probably won't matter very much because they will glued anyway</p>
<p>- The tabs are a different size to the head this time</p>


<h2>February 2, 2023</h2>
<p>- Working on the legs</p>
<p>- Found a major problem with the head, and I fixed it today</p>
<p>- I accidentally extended the tabs out past their measurements, which would have made it a pain to put together</p>
