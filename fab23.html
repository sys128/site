<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

Note that this page is in a <strong>major work in progress state!</strong> The general theme of the page may come in the next week or so.

First day of the semester and I am immediately making some progress on the project. This is because I was working ahead of time. I am also gonna have to work on an HTML implementation of the site in my own time because of two reasons. 

<ol>
  <li>School Chromebooks are extremely limited in what they can do. Getting a text editor such as ViM installed on it would require me to find some sort of workaround to enable the use of the Linux terminal, which would no doubt get me expelled from the school district, so obviously, I can't do that. The other computers that the classrooms contain are even more locked down. It is enough so that you can't even change the keyboard layout because any attempt to access the settings will be futile. With the help of the teacher, I CAN get the layout installed but not be able to actually change it to that.</li>
  <li>Google Sites is also extremely clunky and bloated. For most computer casuals, this is usually not an issue, but for a geek such as myself, I would rather have the lightweightedness of HTML. That would also mean I have the freedom to implement things that I couldn't before, like the ability to do scrolling text, even though it will be counterintuitive in a site project such as this one.</li>
</ol>
